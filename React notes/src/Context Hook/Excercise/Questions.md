# Exercise : Using Conetxt and `useContext` in React

### Step 1: Creating a Context

1.Create a Context 2. Use `useContext` to access data from the Context 3. Share State and Functions between Components without using props

### Step 2: creating a context

1. Create a new file called `userProfile.js`
2. Inside this file, create a `UserContext` and `UserProvider` component that will hold the shared state

### Step 3: using `useContext` in Components

1. Create a new file called `userProfile.jsx`
2. Inside this file create a functional Component `UserProfile`. This component will access the user data from `UserProfile` using the `useContext` hook.

### Step 4: Updating Context data

1. Create a new File called `UpdateUser.jsx`
2. Inside this file, create a functional component called `UpdateUser` that allows the user to update their name.
