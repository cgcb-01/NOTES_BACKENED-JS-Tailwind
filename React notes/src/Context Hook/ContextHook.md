# CONTEXT API

Context API is a feature that allows us to `manage and share state` across our component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. It's useful for scenarios where we need to share data or functions across many components, especially when these components are deeply nested.

## Example

In tis Example We have a data in Component C received from the main component Now By prop Drilling We Will Access that data and Will Send the data to component A , and Component B.
