## STATES AND HOOKS

### STATE

State is a way to `store and manage` data that can change over time and affects how te components renders. We define state using the `useState` Hook, which allows you to set an initial value and provides a way to update that state.

### HOOKS

Hooks are a new addition. They let us `use state and oter React features without writing a Class.`

### useState()

useState Hook allows us to `track state` in a functional component. State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracked in application
`const[data,changeData]=useState()`
